          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p> A business graduate with specialisation in marketing and finance. Currently enrolled at University of Surrey for MSc Fintech and Policy. I love to take on new challenges and i seek to capture new oppertunities. My all time favourite quote, "If you can DREAM it, you can DO it." —Walt Disney</p>

            <h3>Analytics</h3>
            <p>I can quickly see the core and essence of an issue. I distinguish between main and secondary issues, foresee the possible consequences of certain choices and can weigh them against one another. I only take action after looking at the issue from multiple angles. Questioning and listening is something I am good at. I keep contemplating before you come to a choice. I weigh all options and are therefore described by others as 'indecisive'</p>

            <h3>Ad Campaign</h3>
            <p>I have experience in running Ad campaign on Facebook and Google. Successfull campaigns for multiple businessess from different countries. Targeting different demographics and geographics to target specific audience to creat maximum leads.</p>

              <h3>Time Management</h3>
              <p>I find that letting paperwork pile up on my desk can distract me, so I make sure that I find time each day to keep it clear. Filing things away gives me closure to tasks that are complete and allows me to stay focused. Although I enjoy working in a busy, open-plan environment, I recognise that this can also be distracting. I sometimes find that if I am focusing on a detailed piece of work with a tight deadline, I benefit from working in a meeting room. This means I am away from distractions which help me focus on the task at hand. I have been involved in complex layers of project management with multiple deadlines. Tasks are usually interdependent, so it was important that I tracked the progress of individual strands to ensure timely delivery.</p>

              <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
              <p>I focus on finding the right solution rather than wanting to prove they are right at all costs. I go beyond a fixated mind set and open up to new ways of thinking and can explore options. I identify when to do a systematic and complex thinking and when to go through short cuts and find an easy solution.</p>
